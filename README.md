A repository for the Craigstutors project.

## Objectives
Our goal is to create a site to aid students in the best way possible through expert tutelage. Craigstutors is an e-learning platform that allows elementary students to book tutors on a variety of subjects. Our AI-powered personality-matching algorithm rates your child’s compatibility with that of a tutor in order to provide our students with the best possible assistance.
