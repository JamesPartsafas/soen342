A repository for the Craigstutors project.

## Objectives
Our goal is to create a site to aid students in the best way possible through expert tutelage. Our AI-powered personality-matching algorithm rates your child’s compatibility with that of a tutor in order to provide our students with the best possible assistance.


## Description
Craigstutors is an e-learning platform that allows elementary students to book tutors on a variety of subjects. Our intensive hiring tests and cutting edge features allow tutorsto help students in whatever way they might need


## Core Features
There are four types of users: Guests, Students, Tutors, and Administrators

### Guests
Guest users can sign up and create an account, as either a student, tutor or administrator. They have access to the homepage to view featured courses, ongoing promotions, featured reviews, and featured tutors. Also accessible is a list of tutors, as well as a full list of all the courses we have to offer. Further access to a contact page where they can find our contact information if they wish to find out more is also available.

### Students
Before starting their lessons, students will be prompted to take a quick personality test to determine the tutors that best match their personality. Students can register for lessons/tutors using an automatic matching system, which uses a timesheet in order to select their weekly availabilities. A shared virtual whiteboard, shared documents, textbooks, question banks, and the course plan will be available to the students at all times, even when not in lesson through a built-in video calling platform.

### Tutors:
Many of the features described in the Students section are also meant to help the tutors do their part more effectively. Tutors can set up meetings with the students, where parents can join as well, using our video call platform. When joining our team, tutors can set up their profile page, where they can write down their bio, add their education, experiences, strengths, languages and personality traits, as well as the times they will be available for tutoring. Tutors will have a massive resource bank where they can find practice test questions, textbooks, co-op learning games, and subject refreshers in order to help the student in the best way possible.

### Administrators:
Administrators will be able to prepare interview tests where they can evaluate candidates and admit only those that will succeed in their roles as tutors. They will also oversee the tutor’s behavior during their sessions: if a tutor gets reported by a student or parent, admins will be able to see it and take the proper disciplinary action. Admins can manage complaints, or find quick replacements for when the assigned tutor is unavailable.
